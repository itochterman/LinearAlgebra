        "## Background\n",
        "\n",
        "Population modeling is useful from many different perspectives:\n",
        "1. planners at the city, state, and national level who look at human populations and need forecasts of populations in order to do planning for future needs. These future needs include housing, schools, care for the elderly, jobs, and utilities such as electricity,water and transportation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. businesses do population planning so as to predict how the portions of the population that use their product will be changing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Ecologists use population models to study ecological systems, especially those where endangered species are involved so as to try to find measures that will restore the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. medical researchers treat microorganisms and viruses as populations and seek to understand the dynamics of their populations; especially why some thrive in certain environments but don't in others.   \n",
        "\n",
        "Using data about the current population along with the knowledge of quality of healthcare, life expectancy, birth rates, and so on, one can create a model that predicts how the population will change over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in Japan and Scandinavian countries, data shows that a large portion of the population is in an older age group and birth rates are low, which suggests that the size of their populations might shrink over time.  On the other hand, countries with a large birth rate might still suffer from shrinking populations if the quality of health care is very low (such that it significantly effects \"survival rates\" and decreases life expectancies).\n",
        "\n",
        "<b>We are going to work with a particular population model to predict how population distribution across age groups changes over time.</b>\n",
